<h1>Javascript Calculator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a simple calculator web application created to strengthen fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a hands-on project to practice and demonstrate the basics of web development.

<h2>Features</h2>
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear and Reset Functionality: Clear the current input or reset the entire calculation.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
HTML: Markup language for structuring the calculator's layout.
CSS: Stylesheets for visual styling and layout.
JavaScript: DOM manipulation techniques to handle user input and perform calculations.

Click the "CLEAR" button to clear the current input.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
Building this calculator was a great experience. The most challenging part was the calculator's functionality- it was challenging, but rewarding to get more acquianted with event handling, DOM manipulation, and javascript logic. Throughout the entire development process, I honed my skills in debugging, while also getting more comfortable with version control. There are some areas I can improve in, such as being more concise in my code. This is a project I'll likely come back to and refine once I get better.
